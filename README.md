To get Vive Trackers working in Unity without HMD:
- https://github.com/biosmanager/unity-openvr-tracking/tree/master

Than use this prefab:
- to visualize the trackers
- identify which are moving
- calibrate all trackers using a reference tracker
- add scene origin/offset.

Rough example scene and prefab included.
